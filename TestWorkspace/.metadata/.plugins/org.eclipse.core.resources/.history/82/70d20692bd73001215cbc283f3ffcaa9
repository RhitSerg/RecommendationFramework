Test Format
-----------
Each package corresponds to one algorithm,
and those algorithms range in complexity.

Within each package, each class corresponds to
one test case. Each class should contain a
source and target method, in that order, along
with comments describing the expected results.
To help document the intent of each test case,
the classes should be named in accordance with
the complexity of the differences between the
source and target method (e.g. "E1.java"
indicates that the source and target methods
have one simple difference).
