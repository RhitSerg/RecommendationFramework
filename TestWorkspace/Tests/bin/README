Test Format
-----------
Each package corresponds to one algorithm,
and those algorithms range in complexity.

Within each package, each class corresponds to
one test case. Each class should contain a
source and target method, in that order, along
with comments describing the expected results.
To help document the intent of each test case,
the classes should be named in accordance with
the complexity of the differences between the
source and target method (e.g. "E1.java"
indicates that the source and target methods
have one simple difference).

The comments follow the format specified below:
1. The actual differences between the source and
   target are listed, beginning with one of the
   following and detailing the difference, 
   including the line number in the source code:
   - (R) for a relabeling
   - (+) for an extra item
   - (-) for an area with something missing
2. Expected pq-Gram difference score estimate
3. Expected recommended edits
